Integrating MongoDB and Node.js in a web application involves setting up a connection between the Node.js server and the MongoDB database. Here are some general steps to follow:

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your computer.

2. Install the MongoDB driver for Node.js using npm.

3. Create a Node.js server and import the MongoDB driver.

4. Connect to the MongoDB database using the MongoClient object.

5. Define routes for your web application and use the MongoDB driver to perform CRUD operations on the database.
